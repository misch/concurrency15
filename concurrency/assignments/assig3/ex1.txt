### Observations & Conclusions ###
The difference between the volatile and non-volatile counters are, as in the last exercises not too well recognizeable. It's very well visible, though, that the different lock implementations have a huge impact on the runtime of the programs:

For example, with 4 threads we have execution times of ~352ms, ~200ms and 100ms for the Filter lock, CAS Lock and CCAS lock, respectively. Clearly, the CCAS lock is the fastest implementation here. This tendency is also clearly visible in the experiments with 8 threads (filter: ~600ms, CAS: ~220ms, CCAS: ~105ms).

Using more threads seems to be more problematic with the Filter lock than with CAS and CCAS. While the Filter lock causes a well noticeable overhead when using more threads (4 threads: ~352ms, 8 threads: ~600ms), the CAS- and CCAS locks cause much smaller overheads. The CCAS has the best scalability among the 3 tested implementations: Doubling the number of threads from 4 to 8 caused only around 5 extra seconds to complete the task of counting a shared counter to 300'000.

### Statistics ###

The counter value is always 300000.
