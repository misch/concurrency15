Assume we have three threads |1|, |2| and |3|. Therefore we have the levels 0 [not interested], 1 and 2, level 3 would correspond to the critical section.

In the following example, thread |1| is overtaken by threads |2| and |3| by an inifinite number of times:


1) |1| is interested and enters level 1.

	level 1: |1| | | victim = |1|
	level 2: | | |

2) |2| is interested and enters level 1.
	
	level 1: |1|2| | victim = |2|
	level 2: | | |

3) |3| is interested and enters level 1.
	
	level 1: |1|2|3| victim = |3|
	level 2: | | |

4) Because |3| entered level 1 and declared itself as the victim, |2| is not a victim anymore and can move on to level 2.
	
	level 1: |1|3| | 	victim = |3|
	level 2: |2| | 		victim = |2|

5) |2| is the only thread on a level >= 2 and can move on to the critical section and after the execution, it unlocks.
	
	level 1: |1|3| | 	victim = |3|
	level 2: | | | 		

6) thread |2| is interested in reentering the critical section and enters level 1.
	
	level 1: |1|3|2| 	victim = |2|
	level 2: | | | 		

7) Because |2| entered level 1 and declared itself as the victim, |3| is not a victim anymore and can move on to level 2.
	
	level 1: |1|2| | 	victim = |2|
	level 2: |3| | 		victim = |3|

8) |3| is the only thread on a level >= 2 and can move on to the critical section and after the execution, it unlocks.
	
	level 1: |1|2| | 	victim = |2|
	level 2: | | | 		

9) thread |3| is interested in reentering the critical section and enters level 1.	
	
	level 1: |1|2|3| 	victim = |3|
	level 2: | | |
