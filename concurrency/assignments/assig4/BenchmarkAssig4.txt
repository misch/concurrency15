The table below contains the average runtimes of 5 runs on the sunfire machine using the number of threads indicated in the very left column.

threads | fine-grained | optimistic
-----------------------------------
2 		|  370.329 ms	| 118.305 ms
4 		| 1405.589 ms 	|  97.562 ms
8 		| 1512.263 ms 	| 161.05 ms


It can be seen that, as expected, the optimistic fine-grain lock approach is much more efficient than the non-optimistic one. The speedup is very high, for example ~14.4 using 4 threads.
